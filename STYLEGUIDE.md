Coding style guide
==================

This is a coding style guide for the jupiterbroadcasting mobile community project.
This document is a work in progress and may be edited as needed..

In general please follow Google's JS style guide found here: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml
However, anything found in this doc will supercede Google's guide. 

Braces: 

Please place all braces on the same line as the statement or conditional.

This goes for 'for' loops and the like as well. 

Variables:

Please make all variable names as descriptive as possible. A good rule of thumb is a reader of your function should be able to understand what you are aiming for without asking.


Semicolons:

Where applicable end your JS lines with a semicolon.

Eval:

Please do not use this unless you have a good reason that you are prepared to defend. There acceptable uses for eval() but we should keep it to a minimum if at all possible.
